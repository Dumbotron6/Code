    This is also known as Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm.
    Sum > high is straightforward. But why if(sum < 0) sum = 0?
    Because at any point if sum becomes less than zero, say [2,-3,4], 4 will always be greater than whatever comes before.
        ie, 4 will always be greater than -1(2-3).
    As long as sum remains positive, anything that adds to it will be higher than individual ele.
